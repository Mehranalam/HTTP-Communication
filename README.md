HTTP Communication
==================

This library is actually a shell of cURL and provides ``CURL`` features and functions under classes and interfaces for use in Java and ``Android projects``.  This library is expected to run on all platforms under the ``JVM``, the CURL tool is a platform-independent terminal kit with a long history.

Despite numerous and optimal libraries, perhaps using this library is not a suitable option, but in the future it may be able to compete with similar examples. Currently, the purpose of this library is to understand how a library communicates with the network, that in the lower layers of requests And how the answers are exchanged.
